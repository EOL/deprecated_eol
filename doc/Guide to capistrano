== Guide to capistrano ==

Check out the project
Capify - This has already been done, and the existing file has been modified.
Check that there's a mongrel_cluster.yml 

On the server, check for the following gems: daemons gem_plugin mongrel mongrel_cluster. Sometimes the mongrel_cluster gem is missing (Hat tip: http://blog.codahale.com/2006/06/19/time-for-a-grown-up-server-rails-mongrel-apache-capistrano-and-you/)
On the workstation, check that the capistrano gem and the mongrel_cluster gems (which requires the mongrel gem) are present. (Hat tip for mongrel_cluster: ibid)

Check that the server has svn, sudo. If it doesn't, then don't forget to find out what OS you're on, and if it's ubutu, go to launchpad.

Capistrano is able to be run as a non-root process with the occasional dash of sudo. Create such a user.

Set up deploy.rb - it's a fair bit of work, so your best bet is to copy from one that works.

Have the non-privileged user do a subversion checkout to the local workstation (unless you're pushing a tarball from the workstation, in which case you'd do the same under your user on your workstation).

Make sure that you've modified any configuration files required, and save them to the repository.

If deploying with Capistrano for the first time:
   1. Check with the programmers whether it's ok to shut down the current web application. Shut down the application (eg with  mongrel_rails stop -P log/mongrel-l.pid ). Copy the current version to a application-old directory. 
   2. Run (remembering to change server_name and nameofapp)
   3. cap server_name invoke SUDO=1 COMMAND="mkdir -m 777 /data/www/rails/nameofapp"
    If it complains "sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo", then set default_run_options[:pty] = true
   4. cap server_name deploy:setup
   5. cap server_name invoke COMMAND="mkdir -m 775 /data/www/rails/nameofapp/shared/config"
        to a directory config within the shared directory.
   6. Put any configuration files that shouldn't be version controlled in there, such as database.yml .
    7. cap server_name deploy:cold

If it works (and why wouldn't it, apart from the paragraph below?), then subsequent deployments are done with 

cap server_name deploy  (e.g. cap wattle deploy) or cap wattle deploy:migrations if you want migrations

to see which server name you are deploying to, do a cap -T

If you're using a windows workstation, you probably can't use tar and gzip. Instead, you'll have to install zip ( from http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html ) on your windows workstation, and unzip on your server box.

Capistrano has the ability to disable or enable rails applications. This requires configuring the apache servers to redirect to a certain page if it exists. http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/01/05#CustomMaintenancePages has some instructions. To disable a web site, run

cap server_name deploy:web:disable REASON="fixing things up" UNTIL="when we fix it"

And to bring the site back up, do

cap server_name deploy:web:enable

== Troubleshooting ==

Possible problem: uploading a zipped file doesn't work - it gives a zero sized file on the server.

Add

set :synchronous_connect, true

Possible problem: having trouble restarting

 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] already stopped port 5000
 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] already stopped port 5001
 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] already stopped port 5002

 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] starting port 5000
 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] ** Ruby version is not up-to-date; loading cgi_multipart_eof_fix
 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] 
 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] ** !!! PID file log/mongrel.5000.pid already exists.  Mongrel could be running already.  Check your log/mongrel.5000.log for errors.
 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] ** !!! Exiting with error.  You must stop mongrel and clear the .pid before I'll attempt a start.
 ** [out :: demo.eol.org] 

Possible cause: mongrel isn't running, but the pid file still exists. Try something like
sudo mongrel_rails stop -P log/mongrel.5001.pid
If it says 
Sending TERM to Mongrel at PID 13524...Process does not exist.  Not running.
Then that may confirm it.

sudo mongrel_rails stop -P log/mongrel-l.pid
will probably fix the problem, saying
Sending TERM to Mongrel at PID 22494...Done.

Then, on your workstation, do
cap demo deploy:start
