  a_pipe_delimited_list_of_licenses: "{{doc-important|The \"{{!}}\" character and \"all\" should not be translated. \"all\" is an API command.}}"
  a_pipe_delimited_list_of_spm_info_item_subject_names: The 'all' should not be translated, it is a command used in the API.
  actions: "{{Identical|Action}}"
  active_colon: "{{Identical|Active}}"
  admin_content_page_edit_tip: A "named route" is a a rails-specific term which means that in order for a URL like "eol.org/some_route" to work, "some_route" needs to be defined in one of the hard-coded config files.
  all_pages: "{{Identical|All pages}}"
  bi_monthly: The meaning here is "twice every month".
  biodiversity_heritage_library: This is the name of a project and should not be translated. See [[w:Biodiversity Heritage Library|Biodiversity Heritage Library]]
  by: This is meant for use in headers, to proceed the name of a community to indicate ownership of a collection.
  by_scientific_name_table_header: This is a table header which sometimes appears immediately after a separate table header that reads "Search".  It is meant to indicate a second column where a link will be provided to search by the scientific name of the taxon (rather than the common name or some synonym).
  cancel: "{{Identical|Cancel}}"
  cannot_be_associated_with_both_a_user_and_a_community: this is an error message which will almost never appear, wherein a collection was associated with both a user and community. This is wrong because a collection can only be created by one or the other.
  cannot_index_collection_item_type_error: Yes, there is a problem here with the gender/etc of the 'type' argument.  But this is a RARE error (it should really never show up, since it means some new kind of object was introduced to the code) and thus we don't really mind if the error here isn't perfect.
  collections: "{{Identical|Collection}}"
  content_summary_table_count_column_header: "{{Identical|Count}}"
  create_community: This is a button label and is not meant to be (fully) grammatical.
  donate: "{{Identical|Donate}}"

        curation_application: "\"Apply\" as in \"apply for a curator job\"."
  home: "{{Identical|Home}}"
  license: "{{Identical|License}}"
  location: "{{Identical|Location}}"
  max_collection_items_error: This wil never, ever be a small number... always at least 500.
  never: This is in regards to the frequency at which the user will receive email. Thus, this case, it means "never, ever".
  on_time_col_header: This is meant as a header for a time column.
  or_copy_them_to_existing_collection: This is intentionally a sentence fragment, as it is much lower on the page...  as a separate header that matches an earlier one.
  or_move_them_to_existing_collection: This is intentionally a sentence fragment, as it is much lower on the page...  as a separate header that matches an earlier one.
  overview: "{{Identical|Overview}}"
  profile: "{{Identical|Profile}}"
  punctuation_comma: This is the symbol used to join lists. (A comma in English.)
  rank_recognized_by_agent: "This resolves in a format similar to this: \"Species recognized by Integrated Taxonomic Information System:\".  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  rank_recognized_by_agent_colon: "This resolves to something similar to this: \"Taxon recognized by IUCN:\", and acts as the header to a navigatable tree of life, showing the relationships between various levels of taxa."
  rank_recognized_by_from_source: "This can resolve in a format similar to this: \"Species recognized by Integrated Taxonomic Information System and T Orrell (custodian) in Catalogue of Life:\".  where the \"and\" was inserted between two values for the \"agent\" variable.  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  recognized_by_as_a_rank: "This resolves in a format like this: \"Integrated Taxonomic Information System as a Taxon\".  In the latter case, this entry would be seen as a paragraph under a header named \"Recognized by\". These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  recognized_by_from_source_as_a_rank: "This entry would be seen as a paragraph under a header named \"Recognized by\".  These can get more complex, as occasionally the values are created with Rails' #to_sentence method.  Thus, you can end up with \"The Integrated Taxonomic Information System and T Orrell (custodian) in Catalogue of Life as a Taxon\", where the \"and\" was inserted between two values for the \"recognized_by\" variable.  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  see_all_collections_with_count_html: This will ALWAYS have more than 1 for the count.
  see_all_communities_with_count_html: This will ALWAYS have more than 1 for the count.
  spm_category_objects_count: SPM = Species Profile Model
  spm_category_partner_count: SPM = Species Profile Model
  taxon_suggested: This is a column header indicating that the values in the column are the taxon names suggested as results for a search term (which is specified in another column).  So, for example, a search term of 'fox' might have 'Vulpes vulpes' as a value in this column.
  toc: TOC =  table of contents
  wants_colon: This is a column header indicating the level of curation ability that a user wants ('full' and 'master' are the possible values in the table.  This does not need to be incredibly clear--it is only seen by admins. Please keep it as short as possible.
  what_is_this_question: "{{Identical|What is this}}"
  never: "This is in regards to the frequency at which the user will receive email.  Thus, this case, it means 'never, ever', not 'never been'."

  a_pipe_delimited_list_of_spm_info_item_subject_names: "The 'all' should not be translated, it is a command used in the API."
  faker:
    lorem:
      words: No need to translate this set of words, obviously.
  replying_to_x: "This is for use by JavaScript, and thus the 'X' is replaced AT RUNTIME, and so the character 'X' (literally--do not use your language's version of 'X', but exactly that character: 'X') must appear in your translation. The result will be something like 'Replying to Jeremy' after replacement."
  results_avg: "these are table column headings, and the \'avg\' is meant to represent \'average\', because we're counting the number of results that occurred, on average, for a search term within a given date range."

      resource:
        harvest_events: "A 'Harvest Event' is the record of when data was imported for a resource (which is a collection of species information), so the term is meant to capture the sense of data being 'harvested' in a single 'event' in time."

      models:
        harvest_event:
          attributes:
            publish:
              inclusion: "This error message will be displayed (after the name of the checkbox on the form) if an admin attempts to flag a harvest event for publishisng in one of the cases where it cannot be published (ie: it musn't already be published and there must not be a more recent model to be published)."
        inaccessible: "This is VERY LOW PRIORITY for translation, please move on; it will only be seen by developers but its inclusion in translations is required for specs to pass."
  user_response: "This is a table column heading where the cells in the column represent the response provided by a user when answering a survey question."
  who_registered_from: "The value of this key is simply 'who registered from' because it is used in the context of a search date range, where the user inputs a start date before this string and an end date after it.  ie: '...a user who registered from ____ to ____'"
  who_registered_before: "The value of this key is simply 'to' because it is used in the context of a search date range, where the user inputs a start date before this string and an end date after it.  ie: '...a user who registered from ____ to ____'"
  add_a_taxon_association_label: "A 'taxon association' is the association between a data object (for example, an image) and a single species (or other single taxonomic entity, such as class, order, or kingdom) ... more simply, a taxon association is saying something like 'This is a picture of a blackbird.'"
  comments_on: "This is meant to be the header for a page where we're listing all of the comments on a particular subject, such as 'Comments on An Image of A Blackbird' or 'Comments on Procyon Lotor' or 'Comments on Jeremy Rice'.  Thus, this string is prepended to the title of the page where the comments were originally left, and these titles are supplied by content partners, so we CANNOT know the number, gender, or other information about the string."
  eol_api_provider_hierarchies: "This is the title for a documentation page describing the API for retrieving provider hierarchy information: the names and ids of the taxonomy ('tree of life') that each of our providers (content partners) must build in order to give us information specific to species within that tree."
  request: "This is a low-level heading used on multiple documentation pages for the EOL API.  The request, in this context, is the URL that a user would use to call the method being documented.  It's the first H3 used on this page, for example: http://eol.org/api/docs/provider_hierarchies"
  uploaded_content: "This is a page title used on an administrative page where the admin can see and edit content (images, PDFs, and the like) which have been uploaded to EOL's content servers."

  donation_sponsorship_content_title: "This is used as a title for the paragraph described by donation_sponsorship_content_description, which you may wish to read before translating this key. Basically, donors are allowed to sponsor efforts specific to particular organisms (say, fish)."
  default_focus_collection_name_from_community: "'name' in this context is the name of a community.  This translated string will become the name of a collection, so a collection that's a focus for \"My Favourite Animals\" will be named something like \"My Favourite Animals' Focus\"."
  failed_login_attempts_with_count: "IN addition to the count, this tells the admin that the preceeding checkbox needs to be checked in order for the user to be allowed to log in at all.  In practice, the count here will never be one or zero, but we need to pluralize it for more complex languages."
  you_may_upload_static_files_fo: "MOU stands for 'Memorandum of Understanding,' which is just an agreement between EOL and the content partner."
  glossary_term: "This indicates a term that should show up with a definition. This translation is only seen by admins."
  term_for_search_admin_ui: "Seen by admins only. Intended to mean a search term to be added for search suggestions."
  page_views_th: "Table heading, used on a row in a two-column table of data about taxon concepts."
  unique_page_views_th: "Table heading, used on a row in a two-column table of data about taxon concepts."
  please_publish_this_resource_notice: "Yes, the stars and the strong here are a bit much, but the admins (who are the only people who will see this) have specifically asked for them, so please preserve them."
  user_commented_on_themself: "The 'user' and 'user_again' will have two different links, but the same user's string.
  The second one needs to be possessive, modifying 'newsfeed'."
  view_verb: "This will only be used as a verb (for link text), as in 'view this entry'."
  contact_us_topics: "This is used as a title (either a page title or a section title), seen only by admins, to describe the possible subjects that will be available in the drop-down menu when an EOL user wants to contact us (you can follow the 'Contact Us' link at the bottom of the site to see the form that the user will pick a topic from)."
  watch_list_newsfeed: "This is used as the label on a tab.  A watchlist is a collection of items (pages, users, images, articles and the like) which the user cares about.  The watchlist newsfeed is a list of \"recent activity\" on each of those items.  It's akin to Facebook's \"activity\" or a Google Plus \"stream\"."
  new_contact_us_topic: "This is a button allowing an admin to add a new topic (subject) to be put in the drop-down on the form of the 'Contact Us' page.  You can click the 'Contact Us' link at the bottom of EOL to see what the resulting form will look like."
  view_in_classification: "This is a link, used on the \"Names\" tab of a species page on EOL, which allows the user to see the species in the context of a specific classification. For example, Catlogue of Life gives us one \"tree of life,\" different from other partner's trees, and you could use this link to view a page in its context without any \"interference\" from the other classifications."
  toc_no_longer_available: "This is seen by admins only.  It represents user activity logs where the user added an article, but for which infomration about which Table of Contents item it had been placed under is now missing. Thus, this is just meant to inform the admin that some information about the TOC was lost."
  main_database_colon: "This is seen only by admins, and is the label used in a table describing the names of the databases used by EOL (there are five: main, main_master, data_master, data, and logging)."

  info_items_col_header: "This is a column header, seen only by admins, indicating which 'Info Items' an aticle is associated with.  Info items are specific entries intended for a Table of Contents (TOC), following a specific standard (which is itself not worth explaining here, other than to point out they are titles used in a TOC). Thus, the values in this column won't be seen on the site, but are used by content partners."
  activity_untrusted_with_reasons_colon: "This is a string used in a log message.  When a curator untrusts a data object, they are given a set of checkboxes to select the reasons for untrusting that object. (Values include things like \"duplicate\" and \"poor quality\").  This information is then logged as plain text in the data object as %{reasons}.  While there can be one or more reasons actually given, we use the singular to simplify things."
  names_children_column_header: "Refers to child elements in a hierarchy tree. 'Children' on EOL is almost always going to be in the context of a tree. So, any node in the tree will have parents, ancestors, children, and descendants."
  edit_the_topic_area_intro: "In this context, the 'topic area' is one text area, the 'email addresses' is another text area, and there is ONE checkbox (called 'active') to be checked. This last checkbox allows admins to add options at one point in time without having them show up, and then to quickly activate them later."
  list_newsletter_emails: "This is a link placed in the admin navigation sidebar that will list all of the email addresses for users who have signed up to receive the EOL newsletter."
  filter_newsfeed_option_all: "This will be a value in a drop-down to allow users to show certain newsfeed item types.  In this case, it allows the users to see messages related to: All (all items will be shown, no filtering)"
  filter_newsfeed_option_messages: "This will be a value in a drop-down to allow users to show certain newsfeed item types.  In this case, it allows the users to see messages related to: Comments (not 'messages', since that tends to imply that the messages are private, and all messages on eol are public, so we call them comments in the GUI."
  filter_newsfeed_option_community: "This will be a value in a drop-down to allow users to show certain newsfeed item types.  In this case, it allows the users to see messages related to: Community"
  filter_newsfeed_option_collections: "This will be a value in a drop-down to allow users to show certain newsfeed item types.  In this case, it allows the users to see messages related to: Collections"

  filter_newsfeed_option_curation: "This will be a value in a drop-down to allow users to show certain newsfeed item types.  In this case, it allows the users to see messages related to: Curation"
  unknown_hierarchy: "This simply indicates that a particular hierarchy (classification, tree of life) is missing.  It's a rare message, grammar not critical here."
  hierarchy_node_missing: "When showing a so-called 'tree of life', sometimes the data for a particular branch of
  that tree has been lost from the database, and this error is shown."

    content_partners:
      index:
        meta_title: "The meaning here is *intended* to be genitive / possessive... but for search optimization, should probably NOT grammatically modify the user_full_name. Additionally, user_full_name should come first."
  classifications_summary_header_with_count: "Please note that there is an exceptional value for zero, here, which does not display the actual count, but instead a brief message explaining that the page the user is viewing is not easily availble on EOL (the user was likely directed here with a specific link) and that there are no *browsable* classifications for this page.  The notion here is that there are some classifications (trees of life) that are stored in EOL's databases, but the user cannot view them (browse them) by default. Note this is used as a header, so punctuation is not (generally) appropriate."
  collection_error_no_items_selected: "The user has caused an error by attempting to move, copy, or delete collection items, without selecting any collection items at all."
  cancel_split: "This is used in the context of curators separating some data from one taxon page; this is the text for the button to cancel that operation."

  classifications_split_column_header: "Column header on table; the cells below this header will have a checkbox, allowing curators to select the row (which represents a classification) for either a split (separated into a new page) or move (merge the data from these classifications onto an existing page)."
  use_as_examplar_note_preferred: "This is a note to the curator that the classification in this row of the table is currently the preferred classification for the page, and thus they *probably* want to select it to complete the merge or split operation... but they don't *have* to."
  fragment_caching_enabled: "Fragment caching is a method of storing in memory various PARTS of pages, in order to speed up page load times for users.  However, it can cause some problems in certain situations, so admins (only) are allowed to turn it on and off."
  left_content_area: "In context where this is used, the left content area is the division of the page on the left
  side. Curators are allowed to create or edit static pages on EOL for instructions or information, and those pages
  have an area on the left where a 'table of contents' is usually provided, called the 'left content areleft content
  areaa'."
  copied_all_items_from_collection_with_count: "This is in the context of an update given to the user immediately
  after taking action, not in a log."

  recognized_by_from_source: 'This shows up in a field or table under the heading "recognized by." The vaue is meant to represent which content provider recognizes this taxon.
