Technology is helping us solve these problems and prevent from happening with new species by drawing the links between names and information.  The Encyclopedia of Life is built to allow all this information to be collected on one page regardless of the name being referred to, be it \"Canis lupus\", \"wolf\", \"loup\" or any other language you can think of."
