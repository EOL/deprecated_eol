Taxon items will contain a 'richness_score'. Richness is a metric represented as an integer between 0 and 100, with a higher number denoting a page with rich content from a wide variety of sources.

Don’t worry, differences of a few points are not very important. Over time we may change the way we calculate this score to better reflect your experience with the site. Let us know what you think by leaving a comment on pages you think we’ve misjudged.</p><h5>Trusted Images</h5><p>Includes all trusted images for this page and pages that appear in a classification below this page. Includes both images that came from trusted partners as well as images coming from partners such as Flickr or Wikimedia Commons that have been trusted by an EOL curator.</p><h5>Unreviewed Images</h5><p>Includes all unreviewed images for this page and pages that appear in a classification below this page. Some EOL partners provide many high quality images that haven’t been reviewed yet. Does not include images that have been untrusted by an EOL curator.</p><h5>Trusted Articles</h5><p>Includes all trusted text articles on the details tab and several articles on the resources tab. Includes text articles from trusted partners. Also includes articles directly contributed to EOL by its members or from Wikipedia that have been trusted by an EOL curator.

  taxon_synonyms_subtab_explanation: "Sometimes taxonomists create new names for groups that already have a name. They may do this because they are unaware of the original name, or they may think the organism before them belongs to a different group when in fact it does not. If two or more names are found to apply to the same group, they are considered synonyms. In most cases, the first name takes priority and is considered to be the valid or accepted name. However, there can be exceptions, and it's not always easy to determine which of a series of synonyms should be considered valid or accepted. Here we list the synonyms provided to EOL by our classification partners. We also include other versions of the name that most likely refer to the same group, for example, misspellings in the literature or different variations of the authorship associated with the name."
