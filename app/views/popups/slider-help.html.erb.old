We have made two changes to the species page.  The first change was to set the default mode from 'showing authoritative information'
to 'showing all information'.  You will still see yellow backgrounds behind content that has not been curated.  The second change
was to remove the slider that allowed you to change the setting from all to authoritative.  You can still change that setting by
visiting <%=link_to 'your preferences',settings_url%> and your choice is always shown on the top right part of the species page.
