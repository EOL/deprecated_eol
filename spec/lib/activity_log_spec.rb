# TODO - There's a lot I'm not testing, here, because I don't believe the Solr syntax *belongs* in this class. We
# could, of course, actually check the string being passed to #search_with_pagination ... but that just strikes me as
# *incredibly* brittle... and exposes a bit of a bad smell about the class being tested.
#
# As is, we test the other responsibilities of the class *reasonably* well, besides, so I'm not entirely upset.
# Exceptions are noted below as TODOs. ...Also, this spec file runs ridiculously fast. ...There's one slow spec and
# I'm not sure which it is, though I hear it thrashing disk. ...I wonder if it's just loading FactoryGirl. (?)
