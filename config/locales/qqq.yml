  a_data_object: "A data object is any kind of media which is not more specifically identifiable (ie: NOT an image, map, video, or sound.)"
  by_scientific_name_table_header: "This is a table header which sometimes appears immediately after a separate table header that reads \"Search\".  It is meant to indicate a second column where a link will be provided to search by the scientific name of the taxon (rather than the common name or some synonym)."
  cannot_index_collection_item_type_error: "Yes, there is a problem here with the gender/etc of the 'type' argument.  But this is a RARE error (it should really never show up, since it means some new kind of object was introduced to the code) and thus we don't really mind if the error here isn't perfect."
  cannot_be_associated_with_both_a_user_and_a_community: "this is an error message which will almost never appear, wherein a collection was associated with both a user and community. This is wrong because a collection can only be created by one or the other."
  by: "This is meant for use in headers, to proceed the name of a community to indicate ownership of a collection."
  for: "This is meant for use in headers, to proceed the name of a community to indicate ownership of a collection."
  or_copy_them_to_existing_collection: "This is intentionally a sentence fragment, as it is much lower on the page...  as a separate header that matches an earlier one."

  you_in_parens: "This is text added to an item in a list that represents you, the logged in user.  ie: John the Baptist, Anthony Goddard (you), Leonardo da Vinci"
  punctuation_comma: "This is the symbol used to join lists. (A comma in English.)"
  taxon_suggested: "This is a column header indicating that the values in the column are the taxon names suggested as results for a search term (which is specified in another column).  So, for example, a search term of 'fox' might have 'Vulpes vulpes' as a value in this column."
  on_time_col_header: "This is meant as a header for a time column."
  create_community: "This is a button label and is not meant to be (fully) grammatical."
  max_collection_items_error: "This wil never, ever be a small number... always at least 500."
  wants_colon: "This is a column header indicating the level of curation ability that a user wants ('full' and 'master' are the possible values in the table.  This does not need to be incredibly clear--it is only seen by admins. Please keep it as short as possible."
  recognized_by_as_a_rank: "This resolves in a format like this: \"Integrated Taxonomic Information System as a Taxon\".  In the latter case, this entry would be seen as a paragraph under a header named \"Recognized by\". These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  recognized_by_from_source_as_a_rank: "This entry would be seen as a paragraph under a header named \"Recognized by\".  These can get more complex, as occasionally the values are created with Rails' #to_sentence method.  Thus, you can end up with \"The Integrated Taxonomic Information System and T Orrell (custodian) in Catalogue of Life as a Taxon\", where the \"and\" was inserted between two values for the \"recognized_by\" variable.  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  rank_recognized_by_agent: "This resolves in a format similar to this: \"Species recognized by Integrated Taxonomic Information System:\".  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  rank_recognized_by_from_source: "This can resolve in a format similar to this: \"Species recognized by Integrated Taxonomic Information System and T Orrell (custodian) in Catalogue of Life:\".  where the \"and\" was inserted between two values for the \"agent\" variable.  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  rank_recognized_by_agent_colon: "This resolves to something similar to this: \"Taxon recognized by IUCN:\", and acts as the header to a navigatable tree of life, showing the relationships between various levels of taxa."
  never: "This is in regards to the frequency at which the user will receive email.  Thus, this case, it means 'never, ever', not 'never been'."
